# 6.1-backbone-like
* I completed this project during Week 6 of my time at The Iron Yard. The assignment was our first using Backbone.js, so its objective was to begin understanding Backbone Models and Collections. The assignment required us to write a custom method on the Model that would increment the number of times the button had been clicked. The link in the description will show the live project. You can also clone the repo if you'd like to get it working locally.
